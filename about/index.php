            <div class="about">
                <p class="lead">While I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades, I specialize in creating professional, modern, and responsive websites. I have the most experience building sites "from scratch" including graphics and copy, but can easily integrate with existing code, content, and infrastructure.</p>
        
                <p class="lead">I've worked with HTML/CSS, javascript, jQuery, frameworks like Bootstrap, WordPress and similar CMS platforms, SEO tools, and Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Brackets. In my free time, I'm exploring back-end languages like PHP and Python. I'm also familiar with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, so I'm comfortable with the command line.</p>

                <p class="lead">When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me practicing yoga, trying out new vegan recipes, cycling through Spotify playlists, or playing video games. I currently work as an SEO Strategist in the Chicago area. I am available for freelance work.</p>
